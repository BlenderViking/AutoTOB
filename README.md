# AutoTOB

## How to use

#### Step 1

Get the <a href="https://finances.belgium.be/sites/default/files/TD-OB1-FR.pdf" target="_blank">TOB report document</a>
and pre-fill any static information: first section with name, national
registration number and address, and the final section's location and signature
(there are multiple ways to fill in a PDF file, I personnaly use Firefox's
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js" target="_blank">built-in PDF viewer</a>
that provides basic editing features).

#### Step 2

Grab the **tax report(s)** from your
Trade Republic application (tap on your profile > Activity > "Monthly tax
report" of the month you want to settle)

#### Step 3

Fill in your **Full name** and **National registration number** in
the "Personnal information" section (these will be used when filling
the bank transfer reference and the subject of the email). You can
then feed the pre-filled **template** and the **tax report(s)** in the related
squares below.

#### Step 4

From then you can hit:
  - **Preview** to get the payment information;
  - **Download** to download the generated tax report to send to the SPF finances;
  - **Download & Send** to download the report and open a pre-filled email form, in which you'll
  simply have to attach the generated report and hit "Send"!
